Origin choices: This build greatly benefits "Death Stalker Mantle"(Durge origin) and Critical hit buffs/gear. Depending on what Wyll gains on their origin, it is uncertain whether this would work with his setup.

**Gear**: You can use any weapon you want given the Pact invocation. Favoured weapons can benefit it too with the additional +1 bonus. 

 *Recommendations if unsure* : 
- Duelist Prerogative paired with Duelist(W4) can greatly benefit with the critical bonus. Pair with Hold Monster/Person for constant criticals every 4-5 attacks!

  - Bloodthirst also works.
  - Jergoral's Greatsword works for AoE coverage

Story decisions:
Depending on your origin:

  - *Durge*: Spare Alfira by knocking her out for potent robe when your non-choice comes in the form of the little devilish goblin.

  - *Universal*: Convince Ethel to give her hair and spare Mayrina for the bonus CHA, Necromancy of Thay is up to you, Spare Us, Swap your class to Wizard upon grabbing Shovel and have her by your side for good for the fistings, withstand the laughing monks checks for bonus Tasha laughings, pass the checks of the Creche device that attempts(kills) you and your tadpole for bonus actions for Illithid goodness.

Additional information on this homebrew build:

- You cannot be disarmed due to pact of the blade. Do remember to CAST it though, else you will drop your weapon!
- You don't have to 100% follow the build to the key. You can change it up and run the weapon you want that synergizes for your fun. You can also swap the Warlock patron around too and everything else.
- While I haven't tested it, you can do a 3/3/3 build. You will however lose out on some feats and spells because of it, but the 3rd subclass could be fighter or rogue for more actions/mobility.
- You are not bound to medium armor. You can run act two cantrip robe(Better spare the quest giver, Durge) if you want to focus on Eldritch blast/cantrip spam, or the Bhaalist robe if your going evil playthrough.

*<sub>Notes: B & W are short for the classes. In Spells for example, B3 = Bard 3, and vice versa.</sub>
