**Race**: *Depends on your focus* - 

- Drow: - Earlier darkness & replacement of your choice for Warlock 3.
- Half Orc: More Critical hit bonuses for damage
- Dwarf - Duergar: For their spells for more buffs and invisibility focus.
- Tiefling - Asmo/Zariel are both good for whichever you prefer
- Githyanki - Astral Knowledge and Psionics for increased mobility on the battlefields.
- Dragonborn - Either RP reasons or if you wish to have coatings on your weapon by the element of your choice.

Origin choices: This build greatly benefits "Death Stalker Mantle"(Durge origin) and Critical hit buffs/gear. Depending on what Wyll gains on their origin, it is uncertain whether this would work with his setup.

**Gear**: You can use any weapon you want given the Pact invocation. Favoured weapons can benefit it too with the additional +1 bonus. 

 *Recommendations if unsure* : 
- Duelist Prerogative paired with Duelist(W4) can greatly benefit with the critical bonus. 
- Justiciar's Scimitar works due to Hell Sight aswell. 
- Bloodthirst also works.

Additional information on this homebrew build:
- You cannot be disarmed due to pact of the blade. Do remember to CAST it though, else you will drop your weapon!
- You don't have to 100% follow the build to the key. You can change it up and run the weapon you want that synergizes for your fun. You can also swap the Warlock patron around too and everything else.
- While I haven't tested it, you can do a 3/3/3 build. You will however lose out on some feats and spells because of it, but the 3rd subclass could be fighter or rogue for more actions/mobility.
- You are not bound to medium armor. You can run act two cantrip robe(Better spare the quest giver, Durge) if you want to focus on Eldritch blast/cantrip spam, or the Bhaalist robe if your going evil playthrough.

*<sub>Notes: B & W are short for the classes. In Spells for example, B3 = Bard 3, and vice versa.</sub>
