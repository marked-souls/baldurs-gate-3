This is a written version of a build found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzvu8VrLYto

Darkness is a large part of this build. Magical, arrows, etc. This build can handle lockpicking and is amazing at passing most checks. Tip: hoard Darkness arrows...

## Levels

### Level 1: Warlock 1

Archfae warlock with:
* Cantrips
  * Eldritch Blast
  * Friends
* Spells
  * Hex
  * Charm Person

### Level 2: Warlock 2

* Spell: Fairy Fire
* Invocations:
  * Agonizing Blast
  * Devil's Sight <<< See in Darkness 

### Level 3: Bard 1

* Cantrips
  * Mage Hand or Vicious Mockery
  * Minor Illusion

  * Tasha's Hideous Laughter
  * Dissonant Whispers
  * Thunder Wave

Kousei's Notes: I went with Tasha's and Dissonant and would again.

### Level 4: Bard 2

* Spells: Feather Fall (free cast ritual outside of combat)

### Level 5: Bard 3

College of Lore Bard and remember to review Reactions tab.

* Spells: Hold Person
* Proficiency: look for Charisma and Social Interaction proficiencies

### Level 6: Bard 4

* Feat: Ability Improvement (CHA -> 18)
* Cantrip: Mage Hand or Vicious Mockery (whichever you didn't take at Bard 1)
* Spells (pick 1)
  * Heat Metal
  * Detect Thoughts

Kousei's Notes: I went with Heat Metal but this build has a ton of concentrations. Detect Thoughts may be a better option as it will help with some checks.

### Level 7: Bard 5

* Spells: Hypnotic Pattern

### Level 8: Bard 6

* Spells: Glyph of Warding
* Magical Secrets
  * Haste
  * Fireball
  * Counter Spell
  * Darkness

Kousei's Notes: I went with Fireball and Darkness as this build can never have enough Darkness. Fireball is excellent AOE (which this build lacks in general) and has a longer range than Glyph of Warding.

* Spells (pick)
  * Dimension Door

  * Greater Invis

### Level 10: Bard 8

* Feat: Warcaster

### Level 11: Bard 9

Original Notes: Dominate and Hold are priority over Mass Cure Wounds if you have any support/healers in party.

### Level 12: Bard 10

* Magical Secrets: You'll have access to all lvl 5 and below spells so pick wisely
